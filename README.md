# The-Data-Decal
In-class code examples used in Stat 198: The Data DeCal (Fall 2019)

NOTE: since our data files are large, I have compressed them to ensure that I stay within github's file size limits (100 MB max file size). As such, to run these notebooks, in the different activity directories unzip the data files to a folder called "data", then run the notebooks with the package requirements specified in the text file.
